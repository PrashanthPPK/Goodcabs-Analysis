# Goodcabs Analytics Project ðŸš–ðŸ“Š  

## Project Overview  
This project focuses on analyzing operational metrics for **Goodcabs**, a cab service company dedicated to supporting local drivers in tier-2 Indian cities. The analysis aims to provide actionable insights to improve **trip volume**, **passenger satisfaction**, and **repeat passenger rates** while driving growth and sustainability in the transportation domain.  

## Objectives  
- Assess key metrics: **Trip Volume**, **Passenger Satisfaction**, **Repeat Passenger Rate**, and **Trip Distribution**.  
- Generate ad-hoc SQL-based reports to answer critical business questions.  
- Design an intuitive and self-explanatory dashboard for operational decision-making.  
- Present findings with actionable insights to the Chief of Operations.  

## Tools and Technologies  
- **Python**: Data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and scripting.  
- **SQL**: Ad-hoc analysis and querying large datasets.  
- **Power BI**: Interactive dashboards and visual storytelling.  
- **Tableau** (Optional): Additional visualization support.  

## Dataset and Resources  
- Datasets: Provided operational and customer data from Goodcabs.  
- Metadata: Includes data schema and definitions for better understanding.  
- Supporting Documents:  
  - `primary_and_secondary_questions.pdf`  
  - `ad-hoc-requests.pdf`  

## Key Deliverables  
1. **Ad-hoc Analysis**:  
   - SQL-based analysis addressing critical business queries.  
   - Insights into **trip distribution**, **new vs. repeat passengers**, and **peak hours of operation**.  

2. **Interactive Dashboard**:  
   - Visual representations of key metrics for easy interpretation.  

3. **Presentation**:  
   - Actionable insights and recommendations for operational improvements.  

## Progress Updates
